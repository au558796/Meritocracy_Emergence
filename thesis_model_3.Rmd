# IDEAS FOR RULES:
# taxation is as percentage of income
# risk of death is a function of wealth
# reproduction is a function of wealth
# wealth splits at reproduction
# idea - consumption is a proportion of wealth paid to reduce the risk of death at individual level,
# tax is the proportion paid to reduce the risk of death at group level
# Question to build on: what are the baseline effects of meritocracy?


#-----------------VARIABLES---------------


# Let's have 100 agents in our simulation
nagents <- 100

# Now let's start by defining income as merit based, and endowment as non-merit based.
# First we sample endowment from a gamma distribution, and multiply by a factor of 100.
# This is what the agents inherit
endowment <- rgamma(nagents,1,1)*500 #endowment is gamma distributed

#NB I increased the endowment, give the model more to overcome, so we get a nicer taxation curve
# Now lets sample income from a seperate gamma distribution, with the same parameters,
# and multiply by a factor of 10. This is what agents "earn" each year. This is reward for merit.
income <- rgamma(nagents,1,1)*10 #income is stable and gamma distributed across agents

# If we define Wealth at period 1 as endowment + income, and at each subsequent period as wealth + income
# we can ask how long it takes for income inequality to trump wealth inequality
# Let's simulate 100 trials
ntrials <- 100

# As an outcome, let's rank agents by their current wealth.
# We are interested in how agents rankings for wealth each period relate to

# 1) their endowment
# 2) their income
# let's set up some empty arrays to track that in the simulation
wealth_rank <- array(0,c(ntrials,nagents))
wealth2endowment <- array(0,c(ntrials,nagents))
wealth2income <- array(0,c(ntrials,nagents))
wealth <- array(0,c(ntrials,nagents)) #.. and this is just current wealth on a trial

# we'll also include variable growth rates for individual agents
growth_rates <- array(0,c(ntrials,nagents))

# and also variable tax rates across based on learning
tax_rates <- array(0,c(ntrials,nagents)) # and tax rates

# from this we can define an array called incomeVendowment, which is the difference beteween these two distances
# we need an empty array for this
incomeVendowment <- array(0,c(ntrials,nagents))

# we can use this array to identify when the distance between income and wealth ranking
# becomes shorter than the distance between endowment and wealth ranking
# the earlier this happens, the more meritocratic the society
# we need an empty array for this, and will make it below
# but the goal of any policy should be to minimise this index
# just define wealth as a variable at the outset
wealth[1,] <- endowment + income
# now let's run the simulation as a loop where we update wealth by income
# KILLED OFF###

# ADDITIONS HERE
#NB Here we add another loop, where we run different taxation rates to get a taxation curve
# but first we specify the taxation rates we want to run over
#tax_rates <- seq(0.01,.7,.01)

# now let's define our merit index as an empty array the same size as tax_rates,
# so we can track the index across taxation levels
merit_index <- array(0,length(tax_rates))
growth_rate <- 0

# for this learning model, let's also set the level of tax rate change, based on adaptation.
# let's just set this at something now and do sensitivity analysis
# prospect/value theory
# This is where the nudge occurs
tax_rate_delta <- .01

#dana: make this a function of something? (of growth?)
#dana: we can also make this a list of distributions, and depending on the growth we can select which distribution we sample from, or have one distributions of which the parameters are dependant on the nudge. Makes it a bit more noisy (even though it would be out-of-character of a rational agent perhaps? Also no idea if this represents real cognitive processing so I don't know if it makes sense)
#dana: some people will not contribute no matter what (freeriders), do we include this?
# the nudge will have to influence the distribution/function/delta/whatever to have a positive skew (after the nudge, people should contribute more)

  # Illusion of control:  The tendency to overestimate one's degree of influence over other   external events
  # Money illusion: 	The tendency to concentrate on the nominal value (face value) of money   rather than its value in terms of purchasing power
  # Weber–Fechner law: 	Difficulty in comparing small differences in large                    quantities.

# Hyperbolic discounting: 	Discounting is the tendency for people to have a stronger preference for more immediate payoffs relative to later payoffs. Hyperbolic discounting leads to choices that are inconsistent over time – people make choices today that their future selves would prefer not to have made, despite using the same reasoning
  # ---> make a way for agents to think long-term
